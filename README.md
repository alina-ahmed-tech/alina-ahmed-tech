- 👋 Hello, I’m a final year Artificial Intelligence (AI) BSc student
- 👀 I’m interested in: deep learning 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: probabilistic robotics
- 📫 How to reach me: alina.144.132@gmail.com
- ⚡ About Me: I thrive on challenges and pushing myself, I love problem-solving and am incredibly stubborn - I do not give up easily! I am a fast learner and love learning, it does not even feel like work to me because I am such a curious person.
-  👩‍💻 My story: I am really passionate about CS and AI, I've been building robots and coding since I was young! I used to volunteer at a local Young Coders Club when I was 12-16yrs old, helping others around my age get into coding and CS.
